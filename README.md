# Lights-out-code-In

This is the game I developed for the 'Technitude 2022' event.
It is a Maze game where you take control of the player to escape the maze.
There are keycards in the game which you have to collect to proceed further

### Not just that!
With every keycard you collect you will be asked to enter a passcode which you can get by solving a coding related problem  everytime you collect the keycard.

I have used Azure PlayFab to store the user login data and game stats on the Database.
